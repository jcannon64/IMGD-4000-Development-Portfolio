# Scaling the Summit

Scaling the Summit is a third-person platformer where you play as a baby lizard trying to get off of a mountain by fixing a gondola in an abandoned village. Starting from deep within a cave, you must collect gondola parts, avoid golems, and find runes to unlock abilities inspired by real lizards. I was one of three programmers on the six person team developing this game, made using Unreal Engine 5 with Blueprints in seven weeks.

## Contributions:
My main role in the project was to implement the gameplay mechanics of the lizard. Since Unreal already has a highly editable Blueprint template for a third person character, this meant I focused on the special abilities the lizard would have and the runes that would unlock them. The three abilities include a tongue grapple,

a glide,

and camouflage to avoid the enemy golems.

I was also responsible for integrating most of the art assets into the game, including creating blend spaces for the lizard and golem and playing animations that couldn't be added to them. I added several quality of life changes and other minor additions such as the ending sequence, level transistions, and parts of the UI. I also helped with merging different versions of the game and fixing merge conflicts that came with it.

## Challenges:
The biggest challenge I faced by far was implementing the grapple ability.
